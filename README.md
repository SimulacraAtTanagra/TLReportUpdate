## The purpose of this project is as follows:
This was used to extract data automatically, but not procedurally, from an MS Access database administrated elsewhere.
## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
The time and leave db was sensitive to closing conditions, which were often violated by insufficiently cautious users. This resulted in an instability that led to a lot of system downtime that we had to find some way to work around. This project allowed us to have a backup for looking data up when the system was down. 
## This project leverages the following libraries:
pywin32, pandas, pyautogui
## In order to use this, you'll first need do the following:
No user should run this project. The time and leave database was proprietary and is now deprecated. This should only be used as a framework to (poorly) extract data from access databases.
## The expected frequency for running this code is as follows:
